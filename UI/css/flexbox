flex boxes:
  -container:
    - The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex.
    - The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
    - The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
    - The justify-content property is used to align the flex items by horizontal axis.
    - The align-items property is used to align the flex items vertically.
    - The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
    - Set both the justify-content and align-items properties to center, and the flex item will be perfectly centered:
    - The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items.

  -item:
    - The order property specifies the order of the flex items.
    - The flex-grow/flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item will grow/shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.
    - The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flex item.
    - The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.
    - The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container. The align-self property overrides the default alignment set by the container's align-items property.
