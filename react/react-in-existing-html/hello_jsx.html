    <!-- According to MDN, if you specify a script tag with a type that's not text/javascript, 
    it will be ignored by the browser: The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't 
    be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME 
    type to denote data blocks. The src attribute will be ignored. In other words, the browser does 
    not load or run index.js in your example. This makes sense - if it did, you'd get a syntax error, 
    as your browser can't understand JSX. What actually happens is that the babel-standalone script 
    looks at your HTML, finds all of the script tags marked text/babel, loads them via XMLHttpRequest, 
    and then compiles and runs them. This is why you're getting CORS errors - the browser's not loading the file, 
    the script is. Unfortunately, I don't think you can resolve this without using a web server or compiling your 
    Babel code ahead of time. -->
